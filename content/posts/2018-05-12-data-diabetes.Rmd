**Nobody wants diabetes. It comes of its own, unbidden**. For some, "Big D" has been a part of their life since childhood. For others it strikes in middle age or even later. That's what happened to me. I have the little-known LADA diabetes, an auto-immune condition. It struck me later in life, coming out of the blue as a complete shock.

**I suppose it was creeping up on me for years, maybe even decades**. Perhaps I even had it from early childhood --- I was not a strong child, and growing up in the dirty, smoke-ridden air of the northern England industrial city of Manchester, I suffered from bronchitis incessantly. 

**But once the condition is accepted as a fact, the question becomes how to adapt to it**. Some people don't get to that stage: they struggle against managing it and eventually succumb to its long-term depradations: necrosis of the extremities leading to amputation; major organ failure; eye disease; a heart attack. I had a brush with some of those, but luckily, emerged relatively unscathed.

**My approach to adaptation has been to regard the misfortune of having diabetes as an opportunity**. I assiduously collected all the data from my various blood sugar meters, and eventually acquired a [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/charge2) that collects heart rate and exercise data.

**I now have over six months of fine-grained data. The next step is to analyse it**. I've been finding out about [Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) and started learning the [R statistical programming language](https://r.stuzog.com/). It's been an interesting exploration, and I'll tell you more about it as things unfold.
