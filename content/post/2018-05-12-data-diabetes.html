<p><strong>Nobody wants diabetes. It comes of its own, unbidden</strong>. For some, “Big D” has been a part of their life since childhood. For others it strikes in middle age or even later. That’s what happened to me. I have the little-known LADA diabetes, an auto-immune condition. It struck me later in life, and it came out-of-the-blue as a complete shock.</p>
<p><strong>I suppose it was creeping up on me for years, maybe even decades</strong>. Perhaps I even had it from early childhood — I was not a strong child, and growing up in the dirty, smoke-ridden air of the north England industrial city of Manchester, I suffered from bronchitis incessantly.</p>
<p><strong>But once the condition is accepted as a fact, the question becomes how to adapt to it</strong>. Some people don’t get to that stage: they struggle against managing it and eventually succumb to its long-term depradations: necrosis of the extremities leading to amputation; major organ failure; eye disease; a heart attack.</p>
