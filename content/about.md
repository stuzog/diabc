**We are an association of British Columbians** who are managing our diabetes using self-monitoring devices.

## Our Aims

**We aim to provide education and support** for new and long-term diabetics to better manage their condition, and to inform governments and health authorities in BC of the health and fiscal advantages of modern glucose monitoring.

**We also wish to improve understanding** by ourselves, by the medical profession, and by health authorities of the data such monitoring devices can provide.

## Our Goals
## 
## We will endeavour to achieve our Aims by:

* **Learning** about traditional, current, and proposed new diabetes self-management techniques and technologies;
* **Helping** of all types diabetics living in BC to maintain their health through active self-management of their condition;
* **Educating** ourselves, the general public, governments, and others about existing and proposed diabetes self-management techniques and technologies; and
* **Representing** the needs and interests of British Columbians who have been diagnosed as having diabetes.
