We'd love to hear from you &mdash; your thoughts, suggestions, or experiences with diabetes and the BC health care system. There are three ways to do this:

* **Comment on a post or page via  [Disqus](https://disqus.com/profile/login/)**. (You will have to **[create an account](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/)** if you don't have one already).

* **Email us at [info@diabeticsbc.ca](mailto:info@diabeticsbc.ca?subject="Contact from DiabeticsBC Web Site")**.

* **Join our [Discussion List](http://diabeticsbc.ca/mailman/listinfo/discussion_diabeticsbc.ca)** and dialogue with others who have or are involved with diabetes. We will only use your email address to reply to you.
