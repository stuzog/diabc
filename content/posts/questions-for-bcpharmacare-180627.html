<p class="subhead">
What went on behind closed doors?
</p>
<p><strong>How BC Pharmacare selects its suppliers is not a very public process</strong>. Although the recent extension of insulin pump coverage to adults is good news, the BC government <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0060-001168">news release</a> and BC Pharmacare’s <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/what-we-cover/medical-supplies-coverage/diabetes-supplies/insulin-pumps-expansion">information page</a> leave many questions unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>There may be good reasons for the selection process being conducted in private,</strong> but as the program involves spending approximately $15 million over the next three years, the public has the right to know how and why BC Pharmacare selected its pump suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>BC Pharmacare has two review processes</strong>, the:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/partners/health-authorities/bc-health-technology-review">BC Health Technology Review</a>, which reviews clinical technologies, and the</li>
<li><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/what-we-cover/drug-coverage/drug-review-process-results">Drug Review Process</a>, for pharmaceuticals, through its
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/partners/health-authorities/bc-health-technology-review/health-technology-assessment-committee">Health Technology Assessment Committee</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which of these processes was used to select the pump suppliers is not clear</strong>. As insulin pumps are a technology, it would seem rational to infer that the first process was used, but as its focus is on hospital-based technologies, perhaps the latter was the case?</p>
<p><strong>Enough speculation! Too many questions remain</strong>. Here’s my list so far:</p>
<div id="access-to-the-program" class="section level2">
<h2>Access to the Program</h2>
<p>A person must be recommended to the program by an endocrinologist or a “diabetes specialist”. It’s difficult to get an appointment with an endocrinologist in BC, which limits access.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the definition of a “diabetes specialist”?</li>
<li>Are there any plans to speed up access to endocrinologists and/or specialists?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="selection-process" class="section level2">
<h2>Selection Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Which review process was followed for insulin pumps?</li>
<li>What was the composition of the selection committee?
<ul>
<li>Were there representatives of the user on the committee?</li>
<li>Were there representatives of the pump suppliers on the committee?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Was the Committee’s deliberations minuted?
<ul>
<li>Are these minutes available to the public?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Was there a public consultation process informing the Committee?
<ul>
<li>If not, why not?</li>
<li>If so, are the responses available to the public?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="selection-criteria" class="section level2">
<h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was this an open process available to all suppliers?
<ul>
<li>Which suppliers applied for consideration?</li>
<li>Which devices and suppliers were considered?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What were the criteria for selection of pump suppliers?
<ul>
<li>Are these criteria available to the public?</li>
<li>Were these criteria weighted in the evaluation?</li>
<li>What weight was given to each of the criteria?</li>
<li>Was cost the primary consideration on the final selection?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How did the various suppliers perform in this evaluation?
<ul>
<li>Is this evaluation available to the public?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tiered-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Tiered Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>What were the reasons behind adoption of a tiered approach for the final selection?</li>
<li>Why were the Omnipod and Medtronic 630G selected as tier1 and tier2 pumps?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sole-sourcing" class="section level2">
<h2>Sole Sourcing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why was a lowest-cost, sole-source approach taken in this case?</li>
<li>Are other types of device being considered for coverage (e.g. FGM)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-contract" class="section level2">
<h2>The Contract</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the value and duration of the supply contracts issued?
<ul>
<li>Is this contract available for public inspection?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are there provisions for performance evaluation during the contract period?
<ul>
<li>Are there provisions for renegotiation based on performance?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
