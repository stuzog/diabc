<p>We’d love to hear from you — your thoughts, suggestions, or experiences with diabetes and the BC health care system. There are three ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comment on a post or page via <a href="https://disqus.com/profile/login/">Disqus</a></strong>. (You will have to <strong><a href="https://disqus.com/profile/signup/">create an account</a></strong> if you don’t have one already).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email us at <a href="mailto:info@diabeticsbc.ca?subject=%22Contact%20from%20DiabeticsBC%20Web%20Site%22">info@diabeticsbc.ca</a></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Join our <a href="http://diabeticsbc.ca/mailman/listinfo/discussion_diabeticsbc.ca">Discussion List</a></strong> and dialogue with others who have or are involved with diabetes. We will only use your email address to reply to you.</p></li>
</ul>
